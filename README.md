# Bus Ticket Reservation System
This repo deals with a simple method of providing an interface 
which can be used for ticket reservation by the admin or a tour bus 
operator. This project aims at digitizing the storage of information 
in binary and text files. This project will provide the administrator 
of the bus agency with various functionalities such as adding new 
bus, deleting a bus, show all buses, book a ticket for the customer 
and display all booked tickets.
